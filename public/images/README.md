1. **Logo File Requirements:**
   - Supported formats: PNG, JPG, or SVG
   - Recommended size: 200x200 pixels (or similar square/rectangular dimensions)
   - File name should be: `logo.png`, `logo.jpg`, or `logo.svg`

2. **Upload Location:**
   Place your logo file in this directory: `/public/images/`

3. **The system will automatically detect and display your logo in:**
   - Top navigation bar (all dashboards)
   - Login page (if applicable)
   - Any other branded areas

## Current Theme Colors
- **Primary (Light Green):** #4ade80
- **Primary Dark (Green):** #22c55e

Your logo should work well against a white background as it will be displayed in the white navigation bar.

## Logo Not Showing?
If your logo doesn't appear after uploading:
1. Clear your browser cache
2. Ensure the file is named exactly: `logo.png`, `logo.jpg`, or `logo.svg`
3. Check that the file is in the `/public/images/` directory
4. Verify the file isn't corrupted and opens correctly in an image viewer
